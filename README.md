# SoFoCompBio22
If you stumbled upon this repo you may be confused. SoFoCompBio is abbreviation for "SOmmarFOrskarskola i berakningsbiologi och bioinformatik" which is a computational biology research internship at karolinska institutet, and I had the pleasure of attending its first iteration in the summer of 2022 among 5 students picked nationally in Sweden, at the Karlsson Hedestam/Murrell Lab. I was additionally even more fortunate to be accepted to the "sommarforskaskola med biomedicinskt inriktning, " karolinska institutets's long-running wet lab summer research program. This allowed me the exclusive opportunity to conduct a joint wet-lab & computational research project.

I kept working on the project after the official last day, titled "Discovery of novel camelid immunoglobulin alleles." With several potential co-author publications in the future so unfortunately not a whole lot can be put on the internet here. However, the project was about progressing the camelid germline VHH repertoire through NGS of PBMC mRNA samples from a huarizo and a computational genome mining algorithm.

If you miraculously came here from my physical copy of my research report, hi! Hope you enjoyed it and hopefully more progress will have been made with my project.

# Overview of the Repo

- Dataï¼š some of the sequence data used in the paper that werent too large in filesize. 
- Figures: a collection of cool figures generated in the analysis that didnt make it to the paper due to the 2500 word limit.
- AnalysisScripts: collection of scripts (except Vsearch commands) described in my methods section that I used to process the rep-seq data.
- UpcomingPackageSRC: collection of other scripts that might end up in the package, most notably including the exact query matching algorithm. THe most important VHH gene finder algorithm (named GMA) is not uploaded there.

# Acknowledgements
Massive thanks to my amazing supervisor Benjamin Murrell who was very dedicated, patient, educative, kind, funny, .. the list goes on. Allround amazing person that continued to work with me after the project. 

Also the organizers of SoFo: Gerald McInerney, Claudia Kutter, among others and the institute for the generous stipend of 3000kr and lots of free snacks and unlimited access to the BioMedicum at KI solna.
